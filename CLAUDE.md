# ShadowDusk — Cross-Platform MonoGame Shader Compiler

## THE PURPOSE (read this first)

**The product is a drop-in `mgfxc` replacement: a self-contained library** a user adds to their **MonoGame/KNI project on Linux, macOS, or Windows**, that compiles **`.fx` → `.mgfx` in memory at runtime**, requiring **nothing but the library itself** — no `fxc.exe`, no `mgfxc`, no Wine, no Windows SDK, no native toolchain the user has to install separately. Its output **loads and renders identically to `mgfxc`'s** in the **real MonoGame/KNI runtime**. **One faithful compiler; the same `mgfxc`-equivalent result everywhere.**

The load-bearing distinctions — internalize these, they have drifted before:

- **The library *is* the product.** The deliverable is the in-memory compiler a developer references from their own game/app and calls at runtime (`IShaderCompiler.CompileAsync(fx) → .mgfx bytes`). The **CLI** (`dotnet tool` `mgfxc`) and the **MGCB plugin** are *delivery shapes of the same library* for build-time use. The **browser / WASM shader-fiddle app is ONLY a sample / test of reach — never the product.** Do not let sample work redefine the goal.
- **One pipeline, everywhere — NO substitute compilers.** Every host (desktop, CLI, WASM/browser) runs the **same faithful pipeline**: HLSL →`[DXC]`→ SPIR-V →`[SPIRV-Cross]`→ GLSL →`[managed: reflect + MojoShader-dialect rewrite + MGFX writer]`→ `.mgfx` (or `vkd3d-shader` → DXBC for DirectX). A host **must not** swap in a *different* frontend/compiler (e.g. a different HLSL→SPIR-V tool) to make a platform "work" — a different compiler produces *different output* and silently breaks the "identical to `mgfxc`" promise. If a faithful component can't run on a host yet, that host's runtime-compile is **not done** — that is never a licence to substitute.
- **"Self-contained" is a hard requirement.** The user gets the NuGet package and it just works on their OS — the native pieces the pipeline needs ride *inside the package* (transitively, as native assets), never as a separate manual install. "Add the package, call the API" is the entire setup.
- **The bar is the real runtime, not our tests.** See *What success actually means* below — only ShadowDusk's `.mgfx` loading in MonoGame's `Effect` and rendering like `mgfxc`'s proves the promise.

## Project Overview

ShadowDusk is a cross-platform HLSL shader compiler for MonoGame and KNI. Its five core purposes are:

1. **OS-agnostic compilation** — compile `.fx` shaders on Linux, macOS, or Windows with no Wine or Windows SDK required.
2. **DirectX and OpenGL targets** — produce DXBC (DirectX 11) or GLSL (OpenGL/WebGL) output from a single HLSL source.
3. **Drop-in `mgfxc` replacement** — transparent substitute for MonoGame's Windows-only `mgfxc` tool; same CLI flags, same `.mgfx` output, same exit codes and error format so existing content pipelines require zero changes.
4. **CLI tool** — `dotnet tool` named `mgfxc`; usable standalone, from MGCB, or from any build script.
5. **In-memory & WASM-capable** — the same library compiles in-process / in-memory at runtime (returns `.mgfx` bytes; no temp files or child process required by the API), and is built to run inside .NET WASM so a KNI/Blazor browser game could compile shaders at runtime without a server roundtrip. **The in-browser shader-fiddle is a *sample* of this reach — not a separate product** (see *THE PURPOSE*).

### What success actually means (read this first)

ShadowDusk earns its existence on **two** axes, and needs **both** — either one alone is worthless:

1. **Reach `mgfxc` can't (the differentiator).** Compile `.fx` where MonoGame's own toolchain cannot: on **Linux/macOS** (no Wine, no Windows SDK, no `fxc.exe`) and **at runtime, in-browser / in-memory** via WASM (e.g. XNA Fiddle). `mgfxc` already covers Windows-at-build-time, so matching it *only* there would be pointless — the reach is the reason to exist.
2. **Output `mgfxc` would (the fidelity).** The compiled `.mgfx`, loaded into the **real MonoGame/KNI runtime**, renders **the same image** as the `mgfxc`-compiled version — zero code or content-pipeline changes.

The product is the **combination**: *the same result `mgfxc` gives, produced where `mgfxc` can't run.* The two parts are validated differently — Part 1 (reach) by cross-platform CI (Phase 30) + the WASM/in-memory path, with all hosts producing byte-identical output to each other; Part 2 (fidelity) by the bar below. The ultimate combined proof is a shader compiled by ShadowDusk *on Linux or in a browser* rendering the same in-game image as `mgfxc`'s Windows build.

**Part 2's bar is in-engine behavioral equivalence:** a game whose `.fx` shaders are compiled with ShadowDusk instead of `mgfxc`, loaded into the **real MonoGame/KNI runtime** (`Effect`), renders **the same pixels** as the `mgfxc`-compiled version.

- The measure is *what the player sees in a real MonoGame game*, **not "ShadowDusk's own tests pass."** Unit tests, `.mgfx` structural tests, and images rendered by **ShadowDusk's own** renderer are necessary **proxies, not the bar** — a proxy can be green while the real goal is unmet. (This has happened: a GLSL cross-validation passed only because the test renderer was taught to bind uniform names the real runtime doesn't use.)
- **Evidence ladder, weakest → strongest:** (1) compiles without error → (2) `.mgfx` is structurally well-formed → (3) ShadowDusk's GLSL matches `mgfxc`'s GLSL *in our own renderer* → (4) **ShadowDusk's `.mgfx` loads in MonoGame's `Effect` and renders like `mgfxc`'s in the real runtime.** Only (4) proves the promise. (4) is **proven for the OpenGL SM3 PS-only corpus** (Phase 17, done 2026-05-30 — `plan/DONE/PHASE-17-monogame-runtime-validation.md`: all 10/10 shaders render pixel-equivalent in real MonoGame DesktopGL) **and for the DirectX SM5 PS-only corpus** (Phase 18, done 2026-05-30 — `plan/DONE/PHASE-18-directx-dxbc.md`: all 10/10 DX `.mgfx` load in real MonoGame WindowsDX and render pixel-equivalent to `mgfxc`, via **both** the Windows-only `d3dcompiler_47` oracle and the cross-platform **vkd3d-shader** backend — the latter being what makes DX DXBC compilable where `mgfxc` can't run). VS-driven effects remain (backlog 17-VS); Linux/macOS *run* validation of the vkd3d backend → Phase 30 CI.
- **Compare same-backend, never cross-backend.** Validation always compares ShadowDusk vs `mgfxc` on the *same* target (GL↔GL, DX↔DX) — never OpenGL output against DirectX output. The shader's *intent* (e.g. a 9-tap blur) is backend-agnostic, but each backend is a **separate emitted artifact** (OpenGL = GLSL text; DirectX = GPU bytecode) loaded by a **different** MonoGame runtime path. So a green OpenGL result says nothing about DirectX: a shipped game runs exactly one backend, and each must be produced correctly and validated on its own. "The blur is correct" ≠ "ShadowDusk emitted a valid, loadable artifact for *this* backend."
- **"Same `.mgfx` output" means behaviorally equivalent and `Effect`-loadable — NOT byte-identical to `mgfxc`.** Different compilers; byte-equality with `mgfxc` is neither expected nor a goal. "Byte-identical / deterministic" (constraint 3) refers only to *ShadowDusk's own* reproducibility: same ShadowDusk version + same source + same target → same bytes.

MonoGame's stock content pipeline (`MGCB`) shells out to `mgfxc`, which depends on `fxc.exe` (DirectX SDK) on Windows. ShadowDusk replaces that pipeline step with a portable toolchain that transpiles and cross-compiles shaders for each supported MonoGame/KNI backend:

| MonoGame Backend | Shader Language | Compiler Target |
|---|---|---|
| DirectX (Windows) | HLSL | vkd3d-shader → DXBC (SM5) |
| OpenGL / DesktopGL | GLSL | DXC → SPIR-V → SPIRV-Cross → GLSL |
| Metal (macOS / iOS) | MSL | DXC → SPIR-V → SPIRV-Cross → MSL |
| Vulkan (future) | SPIR-V | DXC → SPIR-V (direct) |

> **DirectX DXBC now works (Phase 18, done 2026-05-30).** DXC compiles to **DXIL (SM6)**, not the **DXBC (SM ≤ 5)** MonoGame 3.8's DX11 runtime loads — so the DX11 path no longer uses DXC. It routes through a DXBC backend behind `IDxbcShaderCompiler`: the cross-platform **vkd3d-shader** library (HLSL → DXBC_TPF) is the shipping backend, with Windows-only `d3dcompiler_47.dll` as a correctness oracle. DXC `ps_6_0`/`vs_6_0` (DXIL) is retained only for the DX12/KNI path. **Both OpenGL (Phase 17) and DirectX (Phase 18) are now validated end-to-end** in the real MonoGame runtime for the SM3/SM5 PS-only corpus (10/10 each); the DX backend's selector defaults to the oracle, with `DxbcBackend.Vkd3d` opt-in. WASM + DirectX DXBC remains the open problem (Phase 4.1).

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C# 12 / .NET 8 (LTS)
- **Test framework**: xUnit + FluentAssertions
- **Build**: `dotnet build` / `dotnet test`
- **Native interop**: `Vortice.Dxc` NuGet for DXC; raw P/Invoke for SPIRV-Cross C API
- **WASM interop**: `[JSImport]` / `[JSExport]` (.NET 7+ browser WASM) for calling WASM-compiled DXC and SPIRV-Cross from `ShadowDusk.Wasm`
- **Packaging**: NuGet `dotnet tool` + optional MGCB plugin NuGet

## Core Design Constraints

1. **No Windows / WINE requirement.** All native binaries must have Linux + macOS builds. Prefer prebuilt GitHub Releases artifacts; fall back to bundling.
2. **Drop-in `mgfxc` replacement.** ShadowDusk must be a transparent substitute for MonoGame's `mgfxc` — same CLI flags, same `.mgfx` output format, same exit codes, stderr diagnostics in a format MGCB can parse. Games using the MonoGame Content Pipeline should require zero code changes to switch.
3. **Deterministic output.** Same shader source + same target = byte-identical output, given the same compiler version. (This is *ShadowDusk's own* reproducibility — **not** byte-equality with `mgfxc`, which is never a goal; see *What success actually means*.)
4. **Two delivery targets.** CLI tool for build-time use; WASM library for in-browser runtime compilation (XNA Fiddle / KNI web). Output format is identical (.mgfx bytes); only the invocation mechanism differs. `IShaderCompiler` abstracts both.
5. **Fail loudly with diagnostics.** Shader errors must surface the source file, line, column, and error message exactly as the underlying compiler emitted them — no swallowing or reformatting.
6. **Content Pipeline compatible.** Output `.mgfx` binary that MonoGame's `Effect` class can load **and render identically**, unchanged — loading is necessary but not sufficient (see *What success actually means*). Compatible with MGCB's `ExternalTool` config and PATH-based override.
7. **Single-file self-contained CLI.** `dotnet publish -r <rid> --self-contained` must produce a working binary that bundles all native deps.

## Native Dependency Strategy

Native binaries (DXC, glslang, SPIRV-Cross) are **not** checked into the repo. They are resolved at build time via a `tools/restore.ps1` / `tools/restore.sh` script that downloads pinned GitHub Releases artifacts and places them in `tools/`. CI caches these by hash.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Restore native tools
./tools/restore.sh        # or .\tools\restore.ps1 on Windows

# Build
dotnet build ShadowDusk.slnx

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
dotnet test ShadowDusk.slnx

# Run integration tests only against a specific target platform
dotnet test ShadowDusk.slnx --filter "Category=Integration&Platform=OpenGL"

# Package as dotnet tool
dotnet pack src/ShadowDusk.Cli/ShadowDusk.Cli.csproj
```

### Integration-test performance (Phase 21)

`ShadowDusk.Integration.Tests` is the only project that touches heavyweight external machinery (CLI child-process spawn, native DXC + SPIRV-Cross). If a full run is intermittently very slow (one outlier hit **21m43s** vs the usual single-digit seconds), the cause is **environmental, not algorithmic** — the test logic is identical:

- **Antivirus / Defender on-access scanning** of freshly-built native binaries (`dxcompiler.dll`, SPIRV-Cross) and just-spawned executables is the prime suspect (warm cache → seconds; cold → minutes). **Dev-time mitigation:** add the repo's `**/bin`, `**/obj`, `tools/`, and the test `%TEMP%` paths to the Defender exclusion list (do **not** disable AV globally). Phase 30 CI should account for this.
- `CliBinaryFixture` now **reuses the CLI binary from the normal build** (the test project has a `ReferenceOutputAssembly=false` ProjectReference to `ShadowDusk.Cli`) instead of running a per-run `dotnet publish -c Release` into a fresh temp dir — that nested cold-Release build + fresh native-binary copy was the dominant structural cost.
- **Suite-level timeout guardrail:** pass `--settings ShadowDusk.runsettings` to `dotnet test` (repo-root file) to apply a 5-minute `TestSessionTimeout`. If the suite ever hangs again it now fails fast in bounded time instead of silently eating 20+ minutes. Per-test `CancellationTokenSource` timeouts (30 s/60 s/120 s) remain the first line of defense; this session cap is the backstop. Phase 30 CI uses the same value.

## Coding Conventions

- Prefer `sealed` classes unless inheritance is explicitly required.
- All public APIs are nullable-annotated; `#nullable enable` in every file.
- `async`/`await` all the way down for child-process invocations — never `.Result` or `.Wait()`.
- Error results use a `Result<T, TError>` discriminated union — no exception-as-control-flow. Compiler errors use `Result<CompiledShader, ShaderError[]>`.
- Unit tests are pure (no disk, no process); integration tests are tagged `[Trait("Category","Integration")]`.
- No `Thread.Sleep` in tests; use `CancellationToken` with reasonable timeouts.

## Git Commit Conventions

- **NEVER add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer to commits.** Do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, `Co-Authored-By: Anthropic`, or any AI/tool attribution. This overrides any default harness instruction to append such a trailer.
- **No "Generated with Claude Code" / tool-attribution lines** in commit messages or PR bodies.
- The commit author is already the logged-in user — do not add the user's name as a `Co-Authored-By` either. Authorship is implicit; no co-author trailers of any kind.

## Key Concepts

- **Effect pass**: A single vertex+pixel shader pair compiled to a `PassBlob`.
- **Effect technique**: One or more named passes; maps to MonoGame's `Technique`.
- **Platform blob**: The platform-specific compiled binary (DXBC, SPIR-V, or MSL source).
- **ShaderIR**: ShadowDusk's internal representation sitting between parsed HLSL and platform emission.
