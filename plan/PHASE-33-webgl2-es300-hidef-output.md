# Phase 33 — KNI HiDef / WebGL2 (GLSL ES 3.00) compatibility

**Status:** 🟢 Implemented & verified on branch `phase33-kni-hidef-webgl2` (2026-06-03) — RED→GREEN proven in real KNI HiDef/WebGL2 (10/10 load+render), full suite **535/535** green, independently re-verified. **Not merged/pushed; issue #7 not closed** (reserved for the user). Remaining: Task 6 repo-doc housekeeping + Task 7 CI wiring. Root cause verified 2026-06-03; second review pass (consumer-invisibility + adversarial + KNI-runtime) folded in. Reframed from "add a new output target" to "close a one-spot fidelity gap."
**Tracks:** GitHub issue [#7](https://github.com/kaltinril/ShadowDusk/issues/7) — *"Add WebGL2 / GLSL ES 3.00 output target (for KNI HiDef profile)"*, filed by Victor Chelaru (FlatRedBall) for the **XnaFiddle** in-browser KNI runner.
**Roadmap track:** Fidelity / reach (alongside Phase 28).

## TL;DR — the seamless fix

**The bug is NOT that ShadowDusk lacks a WebGL2/ES-3.00 emitter. It is that ShadowDusk emits the pixel-shader colour output as a *raw* `gl_FragColor` write instead of mgfxc's `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` form.** KNI's HiDef/WebGL2 runtime *already* auto-converts the legacy GLSL in a `.mgfx` to ES 3.00 at load time — but its converter only rewrites the `#define`-aliased output (mgfxc's form), so ShadowDusk's raw `gl_FragColor` slips through and crashes under WebGL2.

**Fix:** make `MonoGameGlslRewriter` emit `#define ps_oC{N} gl_FragColor` / `gl_FragData[N]` and write to `ps_oC{N}` (exactly what mgfxc does — verified in the golden). Result, with **zero consumer input, no new `CompilerOptions`/`PlatformTarget`, no new `.mgfx` format, and no KNI changes**:

- One `.mgfx` loads & renders in KNI **Reach** (WebGL1) *and* **HiDef** (WebGL2) — KNI does the ES-3.00 conversion itself.
- It also keeps working on Desktop GL.
- ShadowDusk's output moves **closer** to the mgfxc golden — strictly *more* faithful, not a divergence.

This is the "just works / as seamless as we can make it" outcome. The consumer does **nothing** except (one-time) recompile their `.fx` and be on **KNI ≥ v3.14.9001** — both documentation matters, neither a code/flag change. See *§ Seamlessness scorecard* and *§ The migration gap*.

---

## THE PURPOSE anchor

Serves THE PURPOSE: *"the same `mgfxc`-equivalent result, produced where `mgfxc` can't run."* Today a ShadowDusk `.mgfx` works in a KNI **Reach** game but **fails to load in a KNI HiDef game**. The gap is a fidelity divergence from `mgfxc` that only surfaces under KNI's WebGL2 path. ⚠️ The fix must **not** regress the validated Reach/WebGL1 path (Phases 17/22/23/24), Desktop GL, or DirectX — and it shouldn't, because it makes GL output match the `mgfxc` golden more closely.

---

## § Scope: works for ANY shader — the corpus is only a test proxy

**The fix is a general transformation, not corpus-specific.** The `#define`-output change lives in `MonoGameGlslRewriter` and applies to **every** shader ShadowDusk compiles for GL. The 10-shader corpus is a **test proxy** (evidence-ladder rung 4) — *never* the scope. Any author's `.fx` must benefit, not just the fixtures.

**The bar:** *every shader ShadowDusk already compiles successfully for **KNI Reach / MonoGame DesktopGL** must also load & render in **KNI HiDef / WebGL2**.* HiDef must be **no more restrictive** than the Reach/Desktop path. If a shader an author writes works in KNI/MonoGame via ShadowDusk today, it must work under HiDef — full stop.

**Consequence:** every GL construct the rewriter can emit must be HiDef-correct, **or fail loudly at compile time — never silently produce broken HiDef GLSL.** Construct surface to cover/decide (the corpus exercises only a slice):

| Construct | HiDef status | Action — **AS BUILT** |
|---|---|---|
| Single fragment output | `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` (KNI converts) | ✅ **DONE** — core fix; `SV_Target` **and** `SV_Target0` both collapse to `ps_oC0` (the primary-collapse correctness fix). |
| MRT (`SV_Target1`…) | `#define ps_oC{N} gl_FragData[N]` (KNI converts) | ✅ **DONE** — only `SV_Target1+` map to `gl_FragData[N]`. ⚠️ **Correction:** Sepia/Dissolve are **single-output `SV_Target0`**, NOT MRT — they map to `ps_oC0/gl_FragColor` (verified vs goldens + SPIRV-Cross dump). True MRT is covered by a synthetic 3-output unit test (corpus has no real MRT — DeferredSprite is GL-excluded). |
| `texture2D` | KNI converts → `texture` | ✅ **DONE** — unchanged; corpus + multi-sampler stress (4× `sampler2D` → `ps_s0..ps_s3`) verified. |
| `texture3D` / `textureCube` | KNI converts the *call*, but ShadowDusk never renamed the **decl** | ✅ **DONE (loud guard).** Found pre-existing **silent breakage**: a `samplerCube`/`sampler3D` decl wasn't renamed and `texture()` was wrongly rewritten to `texture2D(non-2D sampler)` (invalid GLSL). Now a **loud `SD0210` compile error** (`ThrowIfUnsupportedSamplerType`). New-construct support is out of scope (Phase 34). |
| `texture2DLod`/`Proj`/`Grad` | KNI does **NOT** convert | ✅ **DONE (loud guard — branch b).** FX9 `tex2Dlod/proj/grad` aren't Reach-supported (fail in DXC). Modern `SampleLevel/SampleGrad` reached the rewriter and emitted `texture2DLod`/`textureGrad` — invalid in WebGL1 FS + unconverted by KNI in WebGL2, and no single-blob form serves both. Now a **loud `SD0210` compile error** (`ThrowIfUnsupportedSampling`). HiDef-safe emission → Phase 34. Explicit `.fx` + unit tests added. |
| Many samplers / large cbuffers / many uniforms | `ps_s{k}` / `ps_uniforms_vec4[]` remap | ✅ **DONE** — 4-sampler shader confirmed to remap cleanly to `ps_s0..ps_s3`; cbuffer remap unchanged & covered by determinism/byte-identity. |
| VS-driven effects | KNI converts `varying`/`attribute` for VS too, but ShadowDusk passes VS through unchanged today | ⏭ deferred to **Phase 28** (PS-only corpus first, mirrors Phase 17/18). |

**Bounded, not unbounded:** Phase 33 does **not** add support for constructs ShadowDusk doesn't already handle in *any* GL path — that would be new feature work. It guarantees **parity**: whatever already works in Reach/Desktop also works in HiDef. New-construct support (e.g. if cube maps aren't handled at all) is a separate effort; the only Phase 33 obligation there is a **loud failure**, not silent breakage. **Validation must add construct-coverage tests beyond the 10 corpus shaders** (LOD/proj, 3D/cube, multi-output, multi-sampler).

---

## The problem (what breaks, and the verified root cause)

ShadowDusk emits the **legacy MojoShader GLSL dialect** (`varying`, `texture2D()`, `#ifdef GL_ES precision mediump float;`, `ps_uniforms_vec4[]`). Valid anywhere a GL context still has `gl_FragColor`:

- ✅ Desktop MonoGame / KNI DesktopGL (compatibility GLSL)
- ✅ KNI **Reach** → WebGL1 → GLSL ES 1.00 *(verified end-to-end in XnaFiddle per issue #7)*

It fails under a strict GLSL ES 3.00 context:

- ❌ KNI **HiDef** → WebGL2 → GLSL ES 3.00 — `gl_FragColor` was removed from the language.

### Reported failure (issue #7)
`new Effect(graphicsDevice, mgfxBytes)` into a KNI **HiDef** game (KNI 4.2.9001, squarebananas/kniSB) throws in `ConcreteShader.CreateShader`:
```
ERROR: 0:16: 'gl_FragColor' : undeclared identifier
ERROR: 0:16: 'assign' : l-value required (can't modify a const)
...
```

### Verified root cause (this is the key finding)
1. **mgfxc/MojoShader emits the fragment output as a `#define` alias**, not a raw write — **verified in our own golden** `tests/fixtures/golden/OpenGL/Grayscale.mgfx`, which contains the literal line `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` and writes to `ps_oC0` (it also uses `varying` + `texture2D`).
2. **KNI's WebGL2/HiDef loader auto-converts legacy GLSL → ES 3.00 at runtime.** `ConcreteShader.CreateShader` → `ConvertGLSLToGLSL300es` (present in **both** `nkast/Kni` *and* the bug-report fork `squarebananas/kniSB`, `main`) prepends `#version 300 es` and rewrites: `varying`→`in/out`, `attribute`→`in`, `texture2D/3D/Cube`→`texture`, `precision mediump`→`highp`, and crucially **`#define X gl_FragColor` → `out vec4 X;`** (and `#define X gl_FragData[n]` → `layout(location=n) out vec4 X;`).
3. **ShadowDusk inlines a *raw* `gl_FragColor` write** at [MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs:246-247](../src/ShadowDusk.GLSL/MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs#L246-L247) — no `#define`. KNI's converter regex matches only the `#define`-aliased form, so ShadowDusk's raw `gl_FragColor =` survives untouched into the ES-3.00 context → `undeclared identifier`.

> So the HiDef failure is a **fidelity gap from `mgfxc`**, surfaced by KNI's WebGL2 conversion path. Fixing the output to match `mgfxc` fixes HiDef *for free*.

### MonoGame HiDef nuance (a question raised this session — now answered)
- **MonoGame *does* support `GraphicsProfile.HiDef`** — it's a **capability tier** (SM/sampler/RT/texture limits), present in MonoGame mainline. HiDef is **not** a KNI-only concept. *(Earlier framing that implied otherwise was wrong.)*
- What is KNI-WebGL-specific is the **context mapping**: KNI maps `Reach → WebGL1`, `HiDef → WebGL2` (strict ES 3.00). **Verified:** MonoGame mainline never switches shader *dialect* by profile — `Shader.OpenGL.cs` compiles the GLSL payload **as-is** (`GL.ShaderSource`), and MonoGame has **no working browser backend** (`Shader.Web.cs` is a `throw new NotImplementedException()` stub). So the precise statement is *"HiDef-on-WebGL2 (a KNI WebGL behavior)"*, **not** *"HiDef is KNI-only."*

## § KNI HiDef runtime & the oracle question *(R3 — done)*

| Question | Answer (sourced) |
|---|---|
| Profile→context | KNI BlazorGL `ConcreteGraphicsDevice`: `Reach → WebGL1`, `HiDef`/`FL10_0 → WebGL2`. ✅ confirms the reporter. |
| Does KNI patch or compile as-is? | **Both, by container.** *Legacy MGFX v10* (what ShadowDusk writes): runtime-patched by `ConvertGLSLToGLSL300es` under WebGL2. *KNIFX (v11)*: stores a pre-built ES-3.00 blob, loaded as-is. |
| Naming/binding under HiDef | **Unchanged from desktop GL.** Samplers bound by name `ps_s0/ps_s1…`; uniforms as a `vec4[]` array named `ps_uniforms_vec4` (no native UBOs). ✅ ShadowDusk keeps its current naming — only the fragment-output `#define` needs fixing. |
| MGFX container | KNIFX v11 = multi-variant directory keyed by `(major,minor,es)`; **legacy MGFX v10 = single blob** consumed via the runtime-patch path. |
| Same-backend oracle? | **Yes** — KNI's effect compiler `ShaderProfileGL.cs` (`ConvertGLSL110ToGLSL300es`) emits the canonical ES-3.00 form; ShadowDusk could diff against KNIFXC output. *(KNIFXC may be Windows-only at build time — [UNCONFIRMED]; not required for the fix.)* |
| MonoGame HiDef | Capability tier, yes; no dialect-by-profile switch; no working browser backend (see nuance above). |

### § KNI converter completeness & version floor *(review pass — sourced 2026-06-03)*

**(a) Version floor — KNI ≥ v3.14.9001.** KNI's runtime legacy→ES-3.00 converter (`ConcreteShader.ConvertGLSLToGLSL300es`, originally `ConvertGLES100ToGLES300`) was **added 2024-09-08 (PR #1833, commit `8ff252ed0`) and first shipped in `v3.14.9001`** (2024-09-23). It is **absent in `v3.13.9001` and earlier** (those pass GLSL straight to `GL.ShaderSource`, no conversion). Present v3.14 → v4.2.9001 → `main`; the reporter's v4.2.9001 qualifies. Consumers on older KNI get no conversion → the fix can't help them. This is a **documentation** floor — the compiler must **not** enforce it (no KNI dependency in the compiler; that would break "self-contained").

**(b) Converter is complete for everything ShadowDusk emits EXCEPT the `texture2DLod/Proj/Grad` family.** From [KNI `ConcreteShader.cs`](https://github.com/kniEngine/kni/blob/main/Platforms/Graphics/.BlazorGL/Shader/ConcreteShader.cs):

| Construct ShadowDusk emits | KNI converts it? |
|---|---|
| `#define X gl_FragColor` → `out vec4 X;` | ✅ (the fix relies on this) |
| `#define X gl_FragData[n]` → `layout(location=n) out vec4 X;` | ✅ (MRT) |
| `texture2D/3D/Cube(` → `texture(` | ✅ |
| `varying`→`in/out`, `attribute`→`in`, `precision mediump`→`highp`, `#version 300 es` prepended | ✅ |
| **`texture2DLod(` / `texture2DProj(` / `texture2DGrad(`** | ❌ **GAP** — KNI's regex `texture(2D\|3D\|Cube)(?=\()` requires `(` immediately after the suffix, so the Lod/Proj/Grad variants are skipped → undefined in ES 3.00 → HiDef compile fail. *(Current corpus emits none — verified — so it doesn't block #7; see Task 3b + Risks.)* |
| raw `gl_FragColor` (no `#define`) | ❌ — only the `^#define`-anchored form is matched (this is exactly why ShadowDusk's raw write fails). |

**Two hard constraints the fix must honor:** KNI's regex is `^#define …` (`Multiline`), so the alias must be **at column 0 on its own line**; and for the post-conversion `out vec4 ps_oC0;` to be valid GLSL it must sit at **global scope before `main()`** — i.e. emit it in the header block, where the golden puts it.

---

## § Emission change-set *(R1 — done; superseded by the seamless fix)*

The **only** change needed for HiDef is the fragment-output form. The rest of the legacy dialect ShadowDusk already emits (`varying`, `texture2D`, `mediump`) is exactly what KNI's converter expects and handles.

**The fix** in [MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs:246-247](../src/ShadowDusk.GLSL/MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs#L246-L247):

| | Today (raw — breaks HiDef) | Fix (mgfxc form — works everywhere) |
|---|---|---|
| Single output | `out_var_SV_Target` → `gl_FragColor` | `out_var_SV_Target` → `ps_oC0`, **emit** `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` |
| MRT output | `out_var_SV_Target{N}` → `gl_FragData[N]` | `out_var_SV_Target{N}` → `ps_oC{N}`, **emit** `#define ps_oC{N} gl_FragData[N]` |

Match the golden's placement (the `#define`(s) sit near the top with the precision header). Everything else in the rewriter is unchanged.

> **Rejected heavier alternative (R1's first proposal):** a parallel `GlslDialect.Es300` rewriter that runs SPIRV-Cross at `#version 300 es`, drops the `roundEven`→`floor` lowering, keeps native `out`/`texture()`/UBOs, etc. This *would* produce a native ES-3.00 blob — but it requires emitting the **KNIFX v11 multi-variant container** (new writer + the consumer's KNI must read it), introduces a profile decision, and buys nothing because KNI already adapts the single legacy blob. Keep only as a **far-future** option if a shader ever needs ES-3.00-only constructs the legacy dialect can't express.

---

## § Selection surface & container *(R2 — done)*

- **Dual-emit into one `.mgfx` is NOT feasible** in ShadowDusk's current format: [`MgfxWriter`](../src/ShadowDusk.Core/MgfxWriter.cs) stores exactly **one blob per shader stage** (keyed by an `isVertexShader` bool) and one profile byte in the header — no per-profile GL variant slot. (KNIFX v11 *does* have a multi-variant directory, but that's a different writer + a KNI-only container.)
- **Good news: dual-emit is unnecessary.** The seamless fix produces **one** legacy blob that serves both profiles, so no container/format/profile-byte change is needed. `PlatformTarget`/`MgfxProfile`/`CompilerOptions` are untouched.
- **No new `MgfxProfile` byte** (would force a KNI loader upgrade and break ABI — the profile byte stays `0 = OpenGL`).

---

## § Chosen "just works" design *(R4 — done)*

**Verdict: emit `mgfxc`'s exact `#define`-aliased fragment output; KNI's own loader self-adapts it to ES 3.00. One blob, both profiles, zero consumer input, no KNI change, no new format. Strategy = "single universal payload," achieved by *closing a fidelity gap* rather than adding a target.**

| Strategy | Verdict |
|---|---|
| 1. Dual-emit both variants | ❌ Blocked by the single-blob container; and unnecessary (KNI adapts the one blob). |
| **2. Single universal payload (the `#define` fix)** | ✅ **Chosen.** The universality is *KNI's* runtime conversion, not a `#if __VERSION__` payload trick (which can't work — ES requires `#version` on line 1, controlled by the runtime). No flag, no format change, strictly more `mgfxc`-faithful. |
| 3. Runtime auto-select via `GraphicsDevice.GraphicsProfile` | ❌ Moot once #2 lands (one blob serves both); useless at build time (no device); would re-introduce a profile decision. |

**Default behavior:** the rewriter always emits the `#define` form for all GL output (it's `mgfxc`'s own output and works on WebGL1, WebGL2, and Desktop GL). **No new consumer-facing flag is required.** Add a defensive `CompilerOptions` opt-out *only* if regression testing finds a Desktop-GL driver that dislikes the `#define` alias (none expected). Do **not** add a `Reach/HiDef` enum — that would leak the profile choice to the consumer, violating "seamless."

### § Seamlessness scorecard — what must the consumer do? (goal: nothing)

| Concern | Status |
|---|---|
| New flag / API / `CompilerOptions` knob to get HiDef-correct output | **None** — verified: `IShaderCompiler.CompileAsync(hlsl, options)` takes no profile arg, [`CompilerOptions`](../src/ShadowDusk.Core/CompilerOptions.cs) has no Reach/HiDef field, and CLI + WASM + library all route through the same `MonoGameGlslRewriter`; the `#define` change is default-on for all GL output. |
| Code change to switch Reach ↔ HiDef | **None** — the same single `.mgfx` serves both. |
| KNI version | **KNI ≥ v3.14.9001** (doc note only — see converter-floor subsection). |
| Recompile existing `.fx` | **Yes — the one unavoidable action** (see migration gap). |

**Rule for implementers:** if any task introduces a flag/enum the consumer must set to get HiDef-correct output, that is a *defect* — reject it. The only sanctioned new option is the defensive Desktop-GL opt-OUT above (default on).

### § The migration gap — the single thing a consumer must do

"Just works" covers **freshly-compiled** output only. A `.mgfx` built by an **older** ShadowDusk still contains the raw `gl_FragColor` write and **still fails in KNI HiDef** — upgrading the package does not heal already-built artifacts. Minimize and surface it:
- **Recompile note** (release notes + README known-issues): *"Upgrade ShadowDusk **and recompile your `.fx`** — pre-existing `.mgfx` keep the old fragment output and still fail under KNI HiDef/WebGL2."*
- **Self-diagnosis (grep-able):** a *broken* `.mgfx` contains a raw `gl_FragColor =` write with **no** `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor`; a *fixed* one contains the `#define`. A consumer can check a given artifact without guessing.
- **Discoverability:** CHANGELOG + README lines that quote the **exact error string** (`'gl_FragColor' : undeclared identifier`) so a web/grep search lands on the fix; close issue #7 with the resolution + recompile note (that comment becomes the top hit).

---

## § Validation plan *(R4 — done)* — reproduce-first (RED) → fix → validate-same-FX (GREEN)

**Verdict: build the KNI HiDef/WebGL2 Playwright harness FIRST and use it to *reproduce Vic's exact failure* on current (unfixed) `main` — a confirmed RED baseline on a specific raw `.fx`. Apply the fix. Then re-run the *same* harness on the *same* `.fx* — it must flip to GREEN (loads + renders). One harness, used as both the repro and the proof; rung-4 bar = "compiles + renders within tolerance vs the Reach render of the same bytes" (KNI-vs-KNI; no `mgfxc` WebGL2 oracle exists → legitimate "reach `mgfxc` can't" validation).**

### Step A — Reproduce (RED), before any code change
Pin a single canonical raw shader as **the repro case** so repro and validation use byte-identical source: **[tests/fixtures/shaders/Grayscale.fx](../tests/fixtures/shaders/Grayscale.fx)** (minimal PS-only; its current ShadowDusk output emits a raw `gl_FragColor` write — exactly Vic's trigger). Then:
1. Build the HiDef harness capability: add `GraphicsDeviceManager.GraphicsProfile = GraphicsProfile.HiDef` to [ShaderFiddleGame.cs](../samples/ShaderFiddle.Web/ShaderFiddleGame.cs), gated by a `?profile=hidef` query param (mirror the existing `?test=` hook). KNI maps HiDef→WebGL2 automatically; the `index.html` `getContext` shim already accepts `webgl2`.
2. Add a `--corpus=sd-hidef` mode to [run-harness.mjs](../tests/ShadowDusk.BrowserTests/run-harness.mjs) (own publish/captures/results dirs; follow the existing `IS_SD`/`IS_FAITHFUL` pattern), passing `?profile=hidef`.
3. Compile `Grayscale.fx` with **current `main` (unfixed)** ShadowDusk → `.mgfx`; `new Effect(gd, bytes)` in the HiDef/WebGL2 context. **Assert it FAILS with `'gl_FragColor' : undeclared identifier`** (Vic's exact error). Record as `RESULTS-SD-HIDEF-REPRO.md` (the RED baseline).
> This both confirms we're fixing the *real* bug and upgrades the root cause from "verified by code+golden inspection" to "empirically reproduced in a real KNI HiDef runtime."

### Step B — Validate the SAME raw FX now works (GREEN), after the fix
Re-run the **exact same harness** on the **exact same `Grayscale.fx`**, now compiled by the **fixed** ShadowDusk: the previously-failing shader must now **load with no GLSL compile error and render within tolerance** vs its Reach render. The single assertion that expected the error in Step A now expects a successful load+render — a clean RED→GREEN on identical input. Then **broaden to the full corpus**: the 10 SM3 PS-only shaders (Grayscale, Invert, TintShader, Sepia, Saturate, Pixelated, Scanlines, Fading, Dots, Dissolve) → require **10/10 load** + 10/10 render within tolerance; write `RESULTS-SD-HIDEF.md`.

- **Reference for the render compare:** the **existing Reach desktop render of the same `.mgfx`** (`RefRenderer` stays the Reach baseline) — a divergence then isolates "KNI's ES-3.00 conversion of our bytes" from the compiler. Reuse `image-compare.mjs` + the existing tolerance ladder.
- **No byte-compare to `mgfxc`** (it has no WebGL2 emitter) — state explicitly this is KNI-itself reach validation.
- **Watch items:** KNI's converter forces `mediump`→`highp`; this may shift **Dissolve**'s discard boundary vs the Reach `mediump` render (the Phase 24 caveat). Treat a Dissolve delta as expected-different and **document**, don't mask. Dots (transcendental) may need its existing wider tolerance.

---

## Implementation tasks (ordered)

> **Red → green bracket on the SAME raw `.fx`.** Task 0 reproduces Vic's failure on current `main` (RED) via Playwright; Task 5 re-runs the identical harness + identical `.fx` after the fix (GREEN). Do **not** skip Task 0 — reproducing first proves we're fixing the real bug and turns the root cause from "inspected" into "demonstrated."

- [x] **0. REPRODUCE FIRST (RED) — Playwright** — ✅ *done (commit 9f3edb3):* HiDef harness (`?profile=hidef` + `--corpus=sd-hidef`) reproduced Vic's exact error in a real KNI HiDef/WebGL2 runtime; `RESULTS-SD-HIDEF-REPRO.md` records all 10/10 LOAD-FAIL (Grayscale etc. with `'gl_FragColor' : undeclared identifier`; Sepia/Dissolve with `'gl_FragData' : undeclared identifier` — see Task 1 note).
- [x] **1. The fix** — ✅ *done (commit c2f5dfb).* In [MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs](../src/ShadowDusk.GLSL/MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs): `RewriteFragmentOutputs` maps each `out_var_SV_Target{N?}` use → `ps_oC{N}` and the `#define` block is assembled as a **separate string after the Pass-2 rewrites**, emitted at **column 0 in the header before `main()`** (verified by unit test). **Correctness finding (matches the task's warning):** HLSL `SV_Target` ≡ `SV_Target0` — DXC/SPIRV-Cross spells the primary `out_var_SV_Target` for `: COLOR` but `out_var_SV_Target0` for `: COLOR0`; **both collapse to `ps_oC0 → gl_FragColor`**, only `SV_Target1+` → `gl_FragData[N]`. Empirically confirmed by dumping SPIRV-Cross output: **Sepia & Dissolve write `out_var_SV_Target0` and the goldens map them to `ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` — they are SINGLE-output, NOT MRT** (the reproduce note's "Sepia/Dissolve are MRT" was wrong; ShadowDusk had been wrongly emitting `gl_FragData[0]` for them, which is why they failed RED with `gl_FragData undeclared`). Discard-only → no `#define`. Name-collision (pre-existing `ps_oC{N}`) → fails loudly.
- [x] **2. Unit tests** — ✅ *done (commit c2f5dfb).* `MonoGameGlslRewriterTests` (25 total, +13 new): (a) `#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` + no raw `gl_FragColor =` write (exactly one `gl_FragColor`, on the `#define` line); (b) placement at column 0, `#define` before first use and before `main()`; (c) true-MRT `SV_Target0/1/2` → `ps_oC0`=gl_FragColor / `ps_oC1`=gl_FragData[1] / `ps_oC2`=gl_FragData[2]; (d) discard-only → zero `#define ps_oC`, zero `gl_FragColor`; (e) name-collision → `MonoGameGlslRewriteException`; **plus** the `SV_Target0`-is-primary collapse, the LOD/proj/grad guard, and the non-2D-sampler guard.
- [x] **3. Re-baseline** — ✅ *done.* No expected-string test needed weakening (existing ones strengthened to assert `ps_oC0`). **byte-identity (SPIR-V vs DXIL) 10/10 still equal**; **determinism 4/4 byte-stable on re-compile**; **mgfxc cross-validation 10/10 PASS** (improved — Sepia/Dissolve now render correctly; both sides functionally `ps_oC0`); **image (PNG) goldens UNCHANGED** (ImageTests 25/25). Full `dotnet test` (final, after the generality fixtures landed): **535/535 pass, 0 fail, 0 skip** (Core 248, HLSL 89, Compiler 13, GLSL 28, Image 25, Integration 132) — independently re-verified. *(An intermediate mid-implementation run showed 528 before the case-insensitive + generality fixtures were added.)*
- [x] **3b. Close (or loudly bound) the `texture2DLod/Proj/Grad` generality hole** — ✅ *done — chose the LOUD GUARD (branch b), see § Scope table + Risks.* **Finding:** the FX9 intrinsics `tex2Dlod/tex2Dproj/tex2Dgrad` are **NOT supported in Reach today** — they fail in DXC ("undeclared identifier"; `FxPreParser` only rewrites plain `tex2D`). The **modern** `Texture2D.SampleLevel/SampleGrad` path DOES reach the rewriter (DXC→SPIRV-Cross emits `textureLod`/`textureGrad`), and the old rewriter silently emitted `texture2DLod`/`textureGrad` — invalid in WebGL1 fragment shaders AND not converted by KNI for WebGL2. Since there is no single-blob form valid in both Reach and HiDef (and the design has no profile knob), the rewriter now **fails loudly** (`MonoGameGlslRewriteException` → `ShaderError SD0210`). **Bonus silent-breakage found & guarded:** `samplerCube`/`sampler3D` were silently rewritten to `texture2D()` on a non-2D sampler (the decl wasn't even renamed) — now a loud compile error. Explicit test shaders added (`.fx`) and unit guards (`[Theory]` for LOD/proj/grad + non-2D samplers). Multi-sampler (4× `sampler2D`) confirmed scales cleanly (`ps_s0..ps_s3`). Full HiDef-safe emission of LOD/proj/grad + cube/3D deferred to Phase 34.
- [x] **4. Regression gate** — ✅ *done.* Full `dotnet test` **535/535** green (above). Reach harness re-run (`--corpus=sd`) + HiDef GREEN harness (`--corpus=sd-hidef`) → see Task 5 / `RESULTS-SD-HIDEF.md`.
- [x] **5. VALIDATE SAME RAW FX (GREEN) — Playwright** — ✅ **DONE — RED→GREEN confirmed in a real KNI HiDef/WebGL2 runtime.** Re-ran the exact Task-0 harness (`node publish-sample-sd-hidef.mjs` with the fixed CLI, then `node run-harness.mjs --corpus=sd-hidef`): the pinned `Grayscale.fx` (was `'gl_FragColor' : undeclared identifier`) now **loads with no GLSL error** and renders at **maxDelta=1**. Full corpus = **10/10 load + 10/10 render within tolerance** → `RESULTS-SD-HIDEF.md` (GREEN). Per-shader: 8/10 at 1-LSB drift; Saturate 3; Dots 11 (documented transcendental tol 12); Dissolve 128 over 0.145% px (localized discard-boundary drift, under budget). **mediump→highp watch-item verified NEGATIVE:** HiDef deltas are byte-identical to the Reach (`--corpus=sd`, WebGL1) run — Dissolve did NOT shift; it's the pre-existing Phase-24 boundary caveat, documented not masked. Reach run re-confirmed 10/10 (no regression, Task 4).
- [x] **6. Housekeeping** — ✅ *done 2026-06-03:* corrected the Key Decision in [plan.md](plan.md); added Phase 33 to the plan index + roadmap; corrected the under-specified [docs/research.md](../docs/research.md) WebGL-version note to the as-built (KNI converts at runtime; no SPIRV-Cross `300 es`); added a root **[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)** entry + a **[README.md](../README.md)** "KNI HiDef / WebGL2 note" (recompile + KNI ≥ v3.14.9001, framed as KNI's floor not a ShadowDusk requirement); wired the HiDef repro+validate runs into [Phase 30 §16 CI](PHASE-30-ci-and-nuget-release.md) (plan). *Remaining (outward, reserved for the user):* **close issue #7** — comment drafted, to be posted once the fix merges/ships.
- [x] **7. Prove it to ourselves (standing guard)** — ✅ *done:* the Task-0 `?profile=hidef` knob is **retained permanently** (the `--corpus=sd-hidef` harness uses it); the sample's interactive default correctly **stays Reach** (broader-compat default); the **CI HiDef corpus run is wired into [Phase 30 §16](PHASE-30-ci-and-nuget-release.md)** as the continuous regression guard for issue #7 (live workflow lands with Phase 30 CI).

## Validation / success bar

- **Reach + Desktop GL + DX (regression gate):** all current tests green; image goldens unchanged; byte-identity 10/10 (re-baselined bytes).
- **HiDef (new, rung 4):** the corpus loads in a **real KNI HiDef / WebGL2** context (`new Effect` → no GLSL compile error → SpriteBatch render within tolerance). XnaFiddle / KNI HiDef is the real runtime → genuine rung-4 *reach* validation.
- **"Just works":** a scratch consumer compiles a `.fx` with **no profile-specific input** and the single `.mgfx` loads in both Reach and HiDef KNI games.
- **Generality (parity, not corpus):** *any* shader ShadowDusk already compiles for Reach/Desktop also works in HiDef — proven by construct-coverage tests **beyond** the 10 corpus shaders (LOD/proj, 3D/cube, MRT, multi-sampler). Anything not yet HiDef-correct **fails loudly at compile time**, never silently. The corpus is a proxy; this bullet is the real bar.

## Risks / open questions

- **KNI version floor — KNI ≥ v3.14.9001 (firm, sourced):** the converter was added in v3.14.9001 (PR #1833, commit `8ff252ed0`); ≤ v3.13.9001 has no conversion and our legacy GLSL fails under HiDef. The reporter's v4.2.9001 qualifies. **Communicate in docs only** (README compatibility line); the compiler must not enforce it.
- **`texture2DLod/Proj/Grad` converter gap (second latent bug, confirmed):** KNI's converter skips these variants — a shader emitting them fails in HiDef even after this fix. Corpus emits none today (verified); guarded by Task 3b; full handling deferred to the Phase-34 follow-up.
- **Migration gap:** pre-fix `.mgfx` stay broken until **recompiled** — the one consumer action; surfaced via the migration-gap section + housekeeping discoverability.
- **`mediump`→`highp` forcing** under HiDef may perturb Dissolve's boundary vs Reach — expected-different; document.
- **MRT (`gl_FragData`)**: corpus is single-output PS-only; emit the `#define gl_FragData[N]` form for correctness anyway (DeferredLighting is excluded from the OpenGL profile, so untested here).
- **Empirical confirmation:** the root cause is verified by code + golden inspection; **Task 0 (reproduce-first) upgrades it to a demonstrated RED** before the fix, and Task 5 is the GREEN proof (the same `.fx` rendering in KNI HiDef). If a shader still fails after the `#define` fix, there may be a *second* residual mismatch — investigate per-shader.

## Carry-forwards / out of scope

- **Native KNIFX v11 multi-variant emission** (a pre-built ES-3.00 blob in a KNIFX container) — only if a shader needs ES-3.00-only constructs the legacy dialect can't express. Not needed for issue #7.
- **New-construct GL support (→ separate effort, only if ShadowDusk doesn't already handle it in *any* GL path)** — Phase 33 guarantees Reach↔HiDef *parity*, not new feature breadth. If a construct (e.g. cube maps) isn't supported in Reach today either, adding it is out of scope here; Phase 33's only obligation is a **loud failure**, not silent breakage. (Texture-LOD/proj that *is* already Reach-supported is **in** Phase 33 scope — see Task 3b.)
- **VS-driven effects under HiDef** — inherits from Phase 28; this phase targets the PS-only corpus first (mirrors Phase 17/18).
- **Desktop GL Core-profile (non-ES) ES-3.00 equivalent** — not required by issue #7.

### Research provenance
Findings R1–R4 gathered 2026-06-03 by parallel research agents (emission change-set, selection/container, KNI runtime + oracle, "just works" design + validation). Root cause cross-verified against the local golden `tests/fixtures/golden/OpenGL/Grayscale.mgfx` (`#define ps_oC0 gl_FragColor` present) and `MonoGameGlslRewriter.cs:246-247` (raw `gl_FragColor` emitted). **Second review pass (2026-06-03)** by three agents — consumer-invisibility, adversarial correctness, KNI-converter completeness — added: the **KNI ≥ v3.14.9001** version floor (PR #1833 / commit `8ff252ed0`), the **`texture2DLod/Proj/Grad` converter gap** (confirmed from KNI source; corpus emits none), the **migration gap** (pre-fix `.mgfx` need recompiling), the seamlessness scorecard, and the `#define` placement/regex-isolation constraints.
